# budget-management-remix

This repo is my first attempt at a budget management app. This was originally built in next.js, but I am liking remix much better.

This is based on the excellent [remix-supabase-auth](https://github.com/arpitdalal/remix-supabase-auth). This is only the beginning. I plan to add transactions for each category of the budget, as well as possible features for a subscription fee with stripe integration. In addition, I plan to work with someone to improve visual layout. Because I'm blind, this is fully accessible with aria alerts and such for important messages. The project is live at https://www.accessible-budgeting.com. If you would like to help, send me an email at westbchris@gmail.com.
